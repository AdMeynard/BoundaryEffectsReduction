  Abstract                 = {he proportional-bandwidth and constant-bandwidth time-frequency signal decompositions of the wavelet, Gabor, and Wilson orthonormal bases have attracted substantial interest for representing nonstationary signals. However, these representations are limited in that they are based on rectangular tessellations of the time-frequency plane. While much effort has gone into methods for designing nice wavelet and window functions for these frameworks, little consideration has been given to methods for constructing orthonormal bases employing nonrectangular time-frequency tilings. In this note, we take a first step in this direction by deriving two new families of orthonormal bases and frames employing elements that shear, or chirp, in the time-frequency plane, in addition to translate and scale. The new scale-shear fun bases and shift-shear chevron bases are obtained by operating on an existing wavelet, Gabor, or Wilson basis set with two special unitary warping transformations. In addition to the theoretical benefit of broadening the class of valid time-frequency plane tilings, these new bases could possibly also be useful for representing certain types of signals, such as chirping and dispersed signals.},

Building on the powerful Kurdyka--{\L}ojasiewicz property, we derive a self-contained convergence analysis framework and establish that each bounded sequence generated by PALM globally converges to a critical point. Our approach allows to analyze various classes of nonconvex-nonsmooth problems and related nonconvex proximal forward--backward algorithms with semi-algebraic problem's data, the later property being shared by many functions arising in a wide variety of fundamental applications. A by-product of our framework also shows that our results are new even in the convex setting. As an illustration of the results, we derive a new and simple globally convergent algorithm for solving the sparse nonnegative matrix factorization problem.},

The stationarization property of surrogates is first explored in a time-frequency perspective and used for devising a test of stationarity relative to an observation time. Then, more general forms of surrogates are developed, directly in time-frequency or mixed domains of representation (ambiguity and time-lag domains included) and it is shown how they allow for other tests of nonstationary features: detection of the existence of a transient in some noise; assessment of nonstationary cross-correlations.},

Some general properties of DSI processes are given. Examples of random sequences with DSI are then constructed and illustrated. We address finally the problem of analysis of DSI processes, first using the inverse Lamperti transformation to analyse DSI processes by means of cyclostationary methods.

  Abstract                 = {We discuss here the convergence of the iterates of the ``Fast Iterative Shrinkage/Thresholding Algorithm,'' which is an algorithm proposed by Beck and Teboulle for minimizing the sum of two convex, lower-semicontinuous, and proper functions (defined in a Euclidean or Hilbert space), such that one is differentiable with Lipschitz gradient, and the proximity operator of the second is easy to compute. It builds a sequence of iterates for which the objective is controlled, up to a (nearly optimal) constant, by the inverse of the square of the iteration number. However, the convergence of the iterates themselves is not known. We show here that with a small modification, we can ensure the same upper bound for the decay of the energy, as well as the convergence of the iterates to a minimizer.},

  Abstract                 = {Nous nous interessons a des processus non stationnaires qui proviennent de la deformation d'un processus stationnaire sous-jacent : les processus localement dilates. Nous cherchons a resoudre un probleme inverse : estimer la deformation a partir d'une seule realisation d'un processus localement dilate. On peut stationnariser localement un tel processus en approchant l'inverse de la deformation par une transformation affine appropriee. A l'aide d'ondelettes generalisees, obtenues en appliquant le groupe des transformations affines a une fonction localisee, nous pouvons ecrire une equation de transport asymptotique, verifiee a fine echelle par la variance des coefficients d'ondelettes d'un processus localement dilate. En deux dimensions, apres avoir introduit une definition de stationnarite adequate pour un processus sur une surface courbe quelconque, nous identifions le terme de vitesse a un gradient de texture connu. Pour estimer la covariance, puisque nous nous disposons que d'une realisation echantillonnee, la moyenne statistique est remplacee par une moyenne spatiale. L'ergodicite est garantie par un resultat de decorrelation des coefficients d'ondelettes du processus localement dilate. L'estimateur de la dilatation locale propose est faiblement consistant lorsque la longueur de la realisation tend vers l'infini. Nous illustrons ces resultats par des exemples numeriques en une dimension et en deux dimensions pour la resolution du probleme de shape from texture en vision artificielle.},

The model, which is suitable for real-time implementation, is based on qualitative and quantitative observations obtained from a physics-based model described in the literature. In the first part of the paper, the physics-based model is presented, followed by a perceptual experiment, whose aim is to identify the perceptually relevant information characterizing the rolling interaction. On the basis of this experiment, we hypothesize that the particular pattern of the interaction force is responsible for the perception of a rolling object. A complete analysis-synthesis scheme of this interaction force is then provided, along with a description of the calibration of the proposed source-filter sound synthesis process. Finally, a mapping strategy for intuitive control of the proposed synthesis process (i.e. size and velocity of the rolling object and roughness of the surface) is proposed and validated by a listening test.},

Auditory cues are investigated here for the evocations of rubbing, scratching, and rolling interactions. A generic sound-synthesis model that simulates these interactions is detailed. We then suggest an intuitive control strategy that enables users to navigate continuously from one interaction to another in an “action space,” thereby offering the possibility to simulate morphed interactions—for instance, ones that morph between rubbing and rolling.},

The EMD has already shown its usefulness in a wide range of applications including meteorology, structural stability analysis, medical studies. On the other hand, the EMD algorithm contains heuristic and ad hoc elements that make it hard to analyze mathematically. In this paper we describe a method that captures the flavor and philosophy of the EMD approach, albeit using a different approach in constructing the components. The proposed method is a combination of wavelet analysis and reallocation method. We introduce a precise mathematical definition for a class of functions that can be viewed as a superposition of a reasonably small number of approximately harmonic components, and we prove that our method does indeed succeed in decomposing arbitrary functions in this class. We provide several examples, for simulated as well as real data.},

EEGLAB functions are organized into three layers. Top-layer functions allow users to interact with the data through the graphic interface without needing to use MATLAB syntax. Menu options allow users to tune the behavior of EEGLAB to available memory. Middle-layer functions allow users to customize data processing using command history and interactive ‘pop’ functions. Experienced MATLAB users can use EEGLAB data structures and stand-alone signal processing functions to write custom and/or batch analysis scripts. Extensive function help and tutorial information are included. A ‘plug-in’ facility allows easy incorporation of new EEG modules into the main menu. EEGLAB is freely available (http://www.sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) under the GNU public license for noncommercial use and open source development, together with sample data, user tutorial and extensive documentation.},

  Abstract                 = {There have been numerous recent strides at making sinewave analysis consistent with time-varying sinewave models. This is particularly important in high-frequency speech regions where harmonic frequency modulation (FM) can be significant. One notable approach is through the Fan Chirp transform that provides a set of FM-sinewave basis functions consistent with harmonic FM. In this paper, we develop a complete sinewave analysis/synthesis system using the Fan Chirp transform. With this system we are able to obtain more accurate sinewave frequencies and phases, thus creating more accurate frequency tracks, in contrast to a system derived from the short-time Fourier transform, particularly for high-frequency regions of large-bandwidth analysis. With synthesis, we show an improvement in segmental signal-to-noise ratio with respect to waveform matching with the largest gains during rapid pitch dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {The perception of different attributes of conspecifics is an integral part of intraspecific communication. It can facilitate the recognition of interaction partners or the assessment of potential mates. Acoustic signals can encode fine-scaled information through the interplay of acoustic variability and specificity. A reliable vocal signature is both unique within a class and variable between classes. Therefore, acoustic complexity might be associated with the number of classes to be discriminated. We investigated the assumption that limitations to signal design may affect the communicative functionality of a signal. To do so, we chose a signal with potentially dual functionality which may therefore display such limitations. In bats, echolocation is used primarily for foraging and orientation but there is increasing support for its additional role in communication. An acoustic analysis of echolocation pulses of the bat Rhinolophus
livosus confirmed sex and individual vocal signatures in echolocation pulses. A habituation edishabituation playback experiment suggested that bats perceived these signatures because listening bats clearly discriminated between the sexes (two classes) and between individuals (representatives of a multiclass category), although to different degrees. The simple acoustic structure of these vocalizations provides sufficient specificity for sex discrimination but has limitations for individual discrimination because pulse parameters of individuals increasingly overlapped with increasing group size. We conclude that selection for the primary function of echolocation restricts the acoustic space available for communication. However, we frequently observed echolocation pulses with conspicuous structural modifications. Statistical analyses revealed that these vocalizations yielded increased individual distinctiveness. Such added systematic variation may indicate a communicative function and perhaps a signalling intent of the emitter, although the latter has yet to be tested. The findings suggest that the required specificity for effective communication could be obtained through modification of echolocation variants when adaptations for orientation and foraging constrain the evolution of complex communication signatures.},

We discuss the use of the M-spectrum for displaying linear time-varying periodic content in a time series realization in much the same way that the spectrum shows periodic content within a realization of a stationary series. We also introduce the instantaneous frequency and spectrum of an M-stationary process for purposes of describing how frequency changes with time. To illustrate our techniques we use one simulated data set and two bat echolocation signals that show time varying frequency behavior. Our results indicate that for data whose periodic content is changing approximately linearly in time, the Euler model serves as a very good
model for spectral analysis, filtering, and forecasting. Additionally, the instantaneous spectrum is shown to provide better representation of the time-varying frequency content in the data than window-based techniques such as the Gabor and wavelet transforms.},

  Abstract                 = {Long-reads, point-of-care, and PCR-free are the promises brought by nanopore sequencing. Among various steps
in nanopore data analysis, the global mapping between the raw electrical current signal sequence and the expected
signal sequence from the pore model serves as the key building block to base calling, reads mapping, variant identification, and methylation detection. However, the ultra-long reads of nanopore sequencing and an order of magnitude difference in the sampling speeds of the two sequences make the classical dynamic time warping (DTW) and its variants infeasible to solve the problem. Here, we propose a novel multi-level DTW algorithm, cwDTW, based on continuous wavelet transforms with different scales of the two signal sequences. Our algorithm starts from low-resolution wavelet transforms of the two sequences, such that the transformed sequences are short and have similar sampling rates. Then the peaks and nadirs of the transformed sequences are extracted to form feature sequences with similar lengths, which can be easily mapped by the original DTW. Our algorithm then recursively projects the warping path from a lower-resolution level to a higher-resolution one by building a context-dependent boundary and enabling a constrained search for the warping path in the latter. Comprehensive experiments on two real nanopore datasets on human and on Pandoraea pnomenusa, as well as two benchmark datasets from previous studies, demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. In particular, cwDTW can almost always generate warping paths that are very close to the original DTW, which are remarkably more accurate than the state-of-the-art methods including Fast-DTW and PrunedDTW. Meanwhile, on the real nanopore datasets, cwDTW is about 440 times faster than FastDTW and 3000 times faster than the original DTW. Our program is available at https://github.com/realbigws/cwDTW},

Since the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to nonlinear and non-stationary processes. With the Hilbert transform, the ‘instrinic mode functions’ yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. The final presentation of the results is an energy-frequency-time distribution, designated as the Hilbert spectrum. In this method, the main conceptual innovations are the introduction of ‘intrinsic mode functions’ based on local properties of the signal, which make the instantaneous frequency meaningful; and the introduction of the instantaneous frequencies for complicated data sets, which eliminate the need for spurious harmonics to represent nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Examples from the numerical results of the classical nonlinear equation systems and data representing natural phenomena are given to demonstrate the power of this new method. Classical nonlinear system data are especially interesting, for they serve to illustrate the roles played by the nonlinear and non-stationary effects in the energy-frequency-time distribution. },

The efficiency of the method to discriminate between various non-stationary signals is illustrated by numerical examples, both artificial and natural.},

FISTA (Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm) is applied to achieve an efficient numerical approximation of the functional.

  Abstract                 = {Time-scale and, to a lesser extent, pitch-scale modifications of speech and audio signals are the subject of major theoretical and practical interest. Applications are numerous, including, to name but a few, text-to-speech synthesis (based on acoustical unit concatenation), transformation of voice characteristics, foreign language learning but also audio monitoring or film/soundtrack post-synchronization. To fulfill the need for high-quality time and pitch-scaling, a number of algorithms have been proposed recently, along with their real-time implementation, sometimes for very inexpensive hardware. It appears that most of these algorithms can be viewed as slight variations of a small number of basic schemes. This contribution reviews frequency-domain algorithms (phase-vocoder) and time-domain algorithms (Time-Domain Pitch-Synchronous Overlap/Add and the like) in the same framework. More recent variations of these schemes are also presented.
Zusammenfassung
Modifikationen von Sprachsignalen und akustischen Signalen im Zeitbereich und, in geringerem Maβe, im Grundfrequenzbereich, sind von groβer theoretischer und praktischer Bedeutung. Es gibt zahlreiche Anwendung, wie z.B. die Sprachvollsynthese (durch Verkettung von akustischen Einheiten), die Umwandlung von Sprachmerkmalen, Fremdsprachenerwerb, aber auch Audiokontrolle und Postsynchronisierung. Um den Anforderungen nach hoher Qualität gerecht zu werden, wurden in letzter Zeit eine gewisse Anzahl an Algorithmen mit ihrer Echtzeitimplementierung vorgestellt, manchmal für sehr kostengünstige Hardwares. Es kann davon ausgegangen werden, daβ die meisten dieser Algorithmen nur geringfügige Varianten desselben Grundschemas sind. Dieser Artikel gibt einen Überblick über die Algorithmen im Frequenzbereich (phase-vocoder) und im Zeitbereich (Time-Domain Pitch-Synchronous Overlap/Add), die sich im gleichen Rahmen bewegen. Mehrere neuere Methoden, die aus diesen Techniken hervorgegangen sind, werden ebenfalls beschrieben.
Résumé
Les techniques de modifications de l'échelle temporelle et, à un degré moindre, de la fréquence fondamentale présentent un intérêt théorique et pratique certain. Les applications sont nombreuses, et incluent, pour n'en citer que quelques-unes, la synthèse de parole à partir du texte (par concaténation d'unités acoustiques), les transformations du timbre de la voix, l'apprentissage des langues étrangères, mais aussi le contrôle audio ou la post-synchronisation. Pour satisfaire ces besoins, un grand nombre d'algorithmes ont été proposés ces dernières années, apparemment différents mais en fait très proches sur le plan des mécanismes de base. Cet article présente les méthodes frequentielles (vocodeur de phase) et temporelles (Time-Domain Pitch-Synchronous Overlap/Add) dans un même formalisme. Plusieurs méthodes plus récentes, dérivées de ces techniques fondamentales sont également décrites.},

We define an evolutionary wavelet spectrum (EWS) which quantifies how process power varies locally over time and scale. We show how the EWS may be rigorously estimated by a smoothed wavelet periodogram and how both these quantities may be inverted to provide an estimable time-localized autocovariance. We illustrate our theory with a pedagogical example based on discrete non-decimated Haar wavelets and also a real medical time series example.},

The study is motivated by some specific signal classes from which departures to stationarity can carry relevant information and has to be estimated. The estimation procedure is based upon explicit modeling of the signal as a wideband stationary Gaussian signal, transformed by time-dependent, smooth frequency modulation. Under such assumptions, an approximate expression for the second order statistics of the transformed signal's Gabor transform is obtained, which leads to an approximate maximum likelihood estimation procedure. The proposed approach is validated on numerical simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {The grey wolf (Canis lupus) is naturally recolonizing its former habitats in Europe where it was extirpated during the previous two centuries. The management of this protected species is often controversial and its monitoring is a challenge for conservation purposes. However, this elusive carnivore can disperse over long distances in various natural contexts, making its monitoring difficult. Moreover, methods used for collecting signs of presence are usually time-consuming and/or costly. Currently, new acoustic recording tools are contributing to the development of passive acoustic methods as alternative approaches for detecting, monitoring, or identifying species that produce sounds in nature, such as the grey wolf. In the present study, we conducted field experiments to investigate the possibility of using a low-density microphone array to localize wolves at a large scale in two contrasting natural environments in north-eastern France. For scientific and social reasons, the experiments were based on a synthetic sound with similar acoustic properties to howls. This sound was broadcast at several sites. Then, localization estimates and the accuracy were calculated. Finally, linear mixed-effects models were used to identify the factors that influenced the localization accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {Our understanding of the evolution and function of animal displays has been advanced through studies of vocal performance. A widely used metric of vocal performance, vocal deviation, is limited by being applicable only to vocal trills, and also overlooks certain fine-scale aspects of song structure that might reflect vocal performance. In light of these limitations we here introduce a new index of vocal performance, ‘frequency excursion’. Frequency excursion calculates, for any given song or song segment, the sum of frequency modulations both within and between notes on a per-time basis. We calculated and compared the two performance metrics in three species: chipping sparrows, Spizella passerina, swamp sparrows, Melospiza georgiana, and song sparrows, Melospiza melodia. The two metrics correlated as expected, yet frequency excursion accounted for subtle variations in performance overlooked by vocal deviation. In swamp sparrows, frequency excursion values varied significantly by song type but not by individual. Moreover, song type performance in swamp sparrows, according to both metrics, varied negatively with the extent to which song types were shared among neighbours. In song sparrows, frequency excursion values of trilled song segments exceeded those of nontrilled song segments, although not to a statistically significant degree. We suggest that application of frequency excursion in birds and other taxa will provide new insights into diverse open questions concerning vocal performance, function and evolution.},

This model enables to synthesize different types of sound sources, such as creaky doors, singing glasses, squeaking wet plates or bowed strings. Based on the perceptual stance that a sound is perceived as the result of an action on an object we propose a genuine source/filter synthesis approach that enables to elude physical constraints induced by the coupling between the interacting objects. This approach makes it possible to independently control and freely combine the action and the object. Different implementations and applications related to computer animation, gesture learning for rehabilitation and expert gestures are presented at the end of this paper.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

The first uses the gathered log-spectrum as fundamental frequency change estimation method, the second uses analysis-by-synthesis approach. Both algorithms are used on a speech segment to compare its output. Further the analysis-by-synthesis algorithm is applied on several real sound signals to measure the increase in the ability to represent real frequency-modulated signals using the Harmonic Transform.},

This case is proven in the paper to be the only one from the aforementioned group that marginalizes the Wigner distribution along line paths, in particular, with a fan geometry. The properties and attributes of the fan-chirp transform (FChT) along with the analytical characterization of harmonically related Gaussian chirplets bear especial relevance in the paper. This analysis shows that for chirp-periodic signals the FChT can reach the limit of the time–frequency (TF) uncertainty principle, while simultaneously keeping the cross-terms at minimum level. The formulation of the fast digital computation of the FChT is also provided in the paper. Two practical scenarios—the analysis of speech with natural intonation and bat ultrasound—validate the theoretical developments and shows manifestly the eloquent competitive performance of the new transform.},

  Abstract                 = {A common assumption used in statistical signal processing of nonstationary random signals is that the signals are locally stationary. Using this assumption, data is segmented into short analysis frames, and processing is performed using these short frames. Short frames limit the amount of data available, which in turn limits the performance of statistical estimators. In this thesis, we propose a novel method that promises improved performance for a variety of statistical signal processing algorithms. This method proposes to estimate certain time-varying parameters of nonstationary signals and then use this estimated information to perform a time-warping of the data that compensates for the time-varying parameters. Since the time-warped data is more stationary, longer analysis frames may be used, which improves the performance of statistical estimators. We first examine the spectral statistics of two particular types of nonstationary random processes that are useful for modeling ship propeller noise and voiced speech. We examine the effect of time-varying frequency content on these spectral statistics, and in addition show that the cross-frequency spectral statistics of these signals contain significant additional information that is not usually exploited using a stationary assumption. This information, combined with our proposed method, promises improvements for a wide variety of applications in the future. We then describe and test an implementation of our time-warping method, the fan-chirp transform. We apply our method to two applications, detection of ship noise in a passive sonar application and joint denoising and dereverberation of speech. Our method yields improved results for both applications compared to conventional methods.},

To compensate for the relaxation of this assumption, we define the generalized DEMON (“demodulated noise”) spectrum representing modulation frequency, which we use to increase the coherence time of such signals. Increased coherence time means longer analysis windows, which provides higher SNR estimators.

The electrocardiography (ECG)-derived respiration (EDR) algorithm enables data acquisition in this manner. However, the EDR algorithm fails in analyzing such data for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) because of their highly irregular heart rates. To resolve these problems, we introduce a new algorithm, referred to as SSTEDR, to extract the breathing dynamics directly from the single lead ECG signal; it is based on the EDR algorithm and the time–frequency representation technique referred to as the synchrosqueezing transform. We report a preliminary result about the relationship between the anesthetic depth and breathing dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm allowing us to extract the breathing dynamics of patients with obvious AF from the single lead ECG signal.},

  Abstract                 = {A new Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) is presented. This new approach consists of sifting an ensemble of white noise-added signal (data) and treats the mean as the final true result. Finite, not infinitesimal, amplitude white noise is necessary to force the ensemble to exhaust all possible solutions in the sifting process, thus making the different scale signals to collate in the proper intrinsic mode functions (IMF) dictated by the dyadic filter banks. As EEMD is a time–space analysis method, the added white noise is averaged out with sufficient number of trials; the only persistent part that survives the averaging process is the component of the signal (original data), which is then treated as the true and more physical meaningful answer. The effect of the added white noise is to provide a uniform reference frame in the time–frequency space; therefore, the added noise collates the portion of the signal of comparable scale in one IMF. With this ensemble mean, one can separate scales naturally without any a priori subjective criterion selection as in the intermittence test for the original EMD algorithm. This new approach utilizes the full advantage of the statistical characteristics of white noise to perturb the signal in its true solution neighborhood, and to cancel itself out after serving its purpose; therefore, it represents a substantial improvement over the original EMD and is a truly noise-assisted data analysis (NADA) method.},

The article contains an overview over locally stationary processes. At the beginning, time varying autoregressive processes are discussed in detail â both as a deep example and an important class of locally stationary processes. In the next section, a general framework for time series with time varying finite dimensional parameters is discussed with special emphasis on nonlinear locally stationary processes. Then, the paper focuses on linear processes where a more general theory is possible. First, a general definition for linear processes is given and time varying spectral densities are discussed in detail. Then, the Gaussian likelihood theory is presented for locally stationary processes. In the next section, the relevance of empirical spectral processes for locally stationary time series is discussed. Empirical spectral processes play a major role in proving theoretical results and provide a deeper understanding of many techniques. The article concludes with an overview of other results for locally stationary processes.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a class of linear predictors for nonlinear controlled dynamical systems. The basic idea is to lift (or embed) the nonlinear dynamics into a higher dimensional space where its evolution is approximately linear. In an uncontrolled setting, this procedure amounts to numerical approximations of the Koopman operator associated to the nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we extend the Koopman operator to controlled dynamical systems and apply the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) to compute a finite-dimensional approximation of the operator in such a way that this approximation has the form of a linear controlled dynamical system. In numerical examples, the linear predictors obtained in this way exhibit a performance superior to existing linear predictors such as those based on local linearization or the so called Carleman linearization. Importantly, the procedure to construct these linear predictors is completely data-driven and extremely simple – it boils down to a nonlinear transformation of the data (the lifting) and a linear least squares problem in the lifted space that can be readily solved for large data sets. These linear predictors can be readily used to design controllers for the nonlinear dynamical system using linear controller design methodologies. We focus in particular on model predictive control (MPC) and show that MPC controllers designed in this way enjoy computational complexity of the underlying optimization problem comparable to that of MPC for a linear dynamical system with the same number of control inputs and the same dimension of the state-space. Importantly, linear inequality constraints on the state and control inputs as well as nonlinear constraints on the state can be imposed in a linear fashion in the proposed MPC scheme. Similarly, cost functions nonlinear in the state variable can be handled in a linear fashion. We treat both the full-state measurement case and the input–output case, as well as systems with disturbances/noise. Numerical examples demonstrate the approach.1},

  abstract = {Boundary effects are caused by incomplete data in the boundary regions when the analysis window gets closer to the edge of a signal. Various extension schemes have been developed to handle the boundaries of finite length signals to reduce the boundary effects. Zero padding, periodic extension, and symmetric extension are some basic extension methods. However, these solutions have drawbacks. In this paper, we consider the problem of handling the boundary effects due to improper extension methods in the wavelet transform for the application of fault diagnosis of rotating machine. An extension algorithm based on curve fitting with properties that make it more suitable for boundary effects reduction is presented. This extension algorithm could preserve the time-varying characteristics of the signals and be effective to reduce distortions appearing at the boundary. Then, an interpolation approach is used in the boundary effects region to further alleviate the distortions. Procedures for realization of these two algorithms and relative issues are presented. Several experimental tests show that the proposed algorithms are efficient to alleviate the boundary effects in comparison to the existing extension methods.},

However, it is not an easy task for existing methods to analyse simultaneously the trend and dynamics of the periodicity such as time varying frequency and amplitude, and the adaptivity of the analysis to such dynamics and robustness to heteroscedastic dependent errors are not guaranteed. These tasks become even more challenging when there are multiple periodic components. We propose a non-parametric model to describe the dynamics of multicomponent periodicity and investigate the recently developed synchro-squeezing transform in extracting these features in the presence of a trend and heteroscedastic dependent errors. The identifiability problem of the non-parametric periodicity model is studied, and the adaptivity and robustness properties of the synchro-squeezing transform are theoretically justified in both discrete and continuous time settings. Consequently we have a new technique for decoupling the trend, periodicity and heteroscedastic, dependent error process in a general non-parametric set-up. Results of a series of simulations are provided, and the incidence time series of varicella and herpes zoster in Taiwan and respiratory signals observed from a sleep study are analysed.},

In addition, misleading interference terms would appear in the scalogram at some conditions. All of these would influence scalogram analysis seriously. In this paper, a reassignment method is used, which can improve the concentration of the scalogram and weaken the interference terms to a certain extent; thus, the readability of the scalogram can be improved. The experimental data for three kinds of faults in rotating machinery: rotor-to-stator rub, oil whirl, coupling misalignment and the actual measurement data from a Pumped Storage Power Generator Unit are analyzed by the scalogram and the reassigned scalogram, and the results by FFT analysis are also given. A comparison among three kinds of analysis results is carried out, and the comparison results indicate that the scalogram can not only reveal the time–frequency features of vibration signal but also highlight the components of low energy. Therefore, it is suitable to extract features of faults at an early stage.},
