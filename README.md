## Overview
This repository contains all the files necessary to perform the algorithm **BoundEffRed** (Boundary Effects Reduction). This is an an efficient forecasting approach for the real-time reduction of boundary effects in time-frequency representations.

***WARNING:*** This algorithm has been designed to work optimally with MATLAB R2020a. We do not guarantee that it will work with earlier versions.

## Contents
